Welcome to this repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repo showcases my work as part of the **AWS Tech Alliance Program** at the **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, where I contributed as an Analytics Engineer.

During this program, I worked with **Olist**, a B2B e-commerce company, to support both the **Sales** and **Marketing** teams through data-driven solutions built using AWS tools like Glue, S3, RDS, and QuickSight.

To explore the projects:

- Interactive Sales Dashboard: Built to empower sellers with real-time sales and logistics insights.
- Marketing Analysis: Focused on analyzing qualified leads and campaign effectiveness for strategic marketing decisions.

Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` with project-specific details, architecture, tools, and outcomes.

 *Happy Exploring!*
